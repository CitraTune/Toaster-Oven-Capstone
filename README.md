# Toaster-Oven-Capstone
Welcome to the github. Here you'll find pdfs from online documentation, sparse for a lot of the components and libraries I used, the code I made (or, the code Copilot made), my testing data, in its raw form as provided by the code, libraries, and whatever else I found necessary to include here. Some parts the computer deemed necessary to include here.

The files in the "src" and "lib" and "Final" folders will be documented, commented, and is relevant. Look there for what is to be run on the ESP32 TFT Screen, the final electronics schematic files, and the tuning data for the final version of my oven.

The overwhelming majority of the code and files in here will not be formatted well. Most of it was not relevant to the final rendition of this project, but rather was data gathered from testing, or versions of code that were used, and then abandoned. Practice runs, tests for hardware that was swapped out, tests to confirm hardware performance, etc. 

Some folders, like .pio and .vscode, lib, .gitignore and such, are for the computer.
