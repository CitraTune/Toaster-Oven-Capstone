# Toaster-Oven-Capstone
The overwhelming majority of the code and files in here will not be formatted well. Most of it was not relevant to the final rendition of this project, but rather was data gathered from testing, or versions of code that were used, and then abandoned. 

The files in the "src" folder will be documented, commented, and is relevant. Look there for what is to be run on the ESP32 TFT Screen, the final electronics schematic files, and the tuning data for the final version of my oven.

Some folders, like .pio and .vscode, lib, .gitignore and such, are for the computer. 

You can see the current program that is being run on the ESP32 in SRC
